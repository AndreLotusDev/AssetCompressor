# File Compression Tool

## Introduction
This repository contains a tool for compressing files. File compression is a process that reduces the size of a file by encoding its data more efficiently. This is particularly useful for saving storage space and for faster transmission of files over the internet.

## How File Compression Works
File compression can be achieved through various algorithms. These algorithms eliminate redundancies, compress data, and represent the original file in a smaller form without losing any information. When you decompress the file, the original data is reconstructed.
